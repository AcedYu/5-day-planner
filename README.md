# 5-day-planner
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is assignment 5 for the program. In this assignment I implement the third party API Moment.js into the base program given. The application emulates an employee's busy schedule. Items can be added to the planner and will keep track of the time to check whether or not events have already happened or not. The app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code.

It contains notable features such as:
- Current day displayed
- Timeblocks for standard business hours, color coded to indicate whether the blocks are in the past, present, or future
- Modifiable blocks to add events
- Persisting data saved in Local Storage
